## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive understanding and application guide for the Prompt-driven Development (PDD) methodology. As the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) increases in modern software development, PDD has emerged as a new paradigm for efficient and effective software creation.

PDD accelerates and enhances each stage of software development—including requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation—by enabling effective interaction with AI through natural language prompts. Key features include natural language-based interaction, iterative improvement processes, integration with existing tools and workflows, and a collaborative approach between AI and developers.

This methodology is directly linked to the following business goals:
- Reduced time-to-market
- Improved cost efficiency
- Enhanced product quality
- Accelerated innovation

Each section addresses a specific aspect of PDD, including real-world use cases and the latest trends. The methodology is designed to integrate with the traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), focusing on improving both the efficiency and quality of the development process.
