This document describes the detailed contents of each phase of the Prompt-driven Development (PDD) methodology. It covers how to apply PDD at each stage of the software development life cycle, the prompt patterns used, key considerations, and best practices.

## Overview

The detailed contents of PDD are organized by the main phases of the software development life cycle, and each phase is explained in a separate document:

1. [Requirements Definition Phase](4.1.prompt-driven-development-methodology-details-requirements.md)
2. [Design Phase](4.2.prompt-driven-development-methodology-details-design.md)
3. [Development Phase](4.3.prompt-driven-development-methodology-details-development.md)
4. [Testing Phase](4.4.prompt-driven-development-methodology-details-testing.md)
5. [Deployment & Maintenance Phase](4.5.prompt-driven-development-methodology-details-deployment.md)

Each phase focuses on the application of PDD, highlights key differences from traditional methodologies, and provides structured guidance for practical implementation.

## Common Structural Elements

Each phase document includes the following common elements:

1. **Phase Overview**: Purpose, scope, and main activities of the phase.
2. **Key Activities & Tasks**: Concrete activities and tasks to be performed in the phase.
3. **Prompt Patterns & Templates**: Effective prompt patterns and templates for the phase.
4. **Key Deliverables**: Main outputs to be produced in the phase.
5. **Quality Criteria & Checklists**: Criteria and checklists for evaluating deliverables.
6. **Tools & Techniques**: Recommended tools and techniques for effective execution.
7. **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of successful application.
8. **Problem-Solving Guide**: Common issues and solutions.

## Inter-phase Linkage

Each phase can be applied independently, but for maximum effectiveness, the linkage between phases is important. The following diagram shows the flow and linkage of information between phases:

```

Each phase receives the outputs of the previous phase as input, processes them, and passes the results to the next phase. This continuous flow ensures consistency and quality of AI-generated outputs.

## Key Questions by Phase

For each phase, the team should ask the following key questions to ensure effective application of PDD:

### Requirements Definition Phase
- Are requirements clearly and concretely defined?
- Do AI-generated additional requirements align with business goals?
- Are the perspectives of all stakeholders appropriately reflected?

### Design Phase
- Does the design satisfy the requirements?
- Are AI-suggested architecture patterns suitable for the system?
- Does the design ensure scalability, maintainability, and security?

### Development Phase
- Does AI-generated code conform to the design specifications?
- Does the code meet coding standards and best practices?
- Is collaboration between developers and AI effective?

### Testing Phase
- Do AI-generated tests adequately verify requirements and functionality?
- Is test coverage sufficient?
- Are detected defects effectively tracked and resolved?

### Deployment & Maintenance Phase
- Is the deployment process automated and reliable?
- Is system monitoring properly configured?
- Are maintenance and improvement activities performed efficiently?

## Scope of Application

PDD can be applied to all stages of the software development life cycle and can be selectively applied depending on the project's characteristics and organizational readiness.

### Application Scope by Development Stage

| Stage | Example PDD Applications | Difficulty | Expected Effect |
|---------|------------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Requirements Definition** | - Automated requirements specification<br>- User story structuring<br>- Requirements inconsistency detection | ★★☆☆☆ | High |
| **Design** | - Architecture pattern recommendation<br>- Interface design support<br>- Data model generation | ★★★☆☆ | High |
| **Development** | - Automated code generation<br>- Refactoring suggestions<br>- Code optimization | ★★★★☆ | Very High |
| **Testing** | - Test case generation<br>- Coverage analysis<br>- Bug prediction | ★★★☆☆ | High |
| **Deployment** | - Deployment script generation<br>- Automated infrastructure setup<br>- Rollback planning | ★★☆☆☆ | Medium |
| **Maintenance** | - Code documentation<br>- Legacy code analysis<br>- Upgrade path recommendation | ★★★★★ | High |

### Suitability by Project Type

The suitability of PDD for each project type is as follows:

1. **Web Applications**
