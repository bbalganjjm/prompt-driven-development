## 1. Definition of the Design Phase

### 1.1 Definition

The design phase is the process of transforming requirements into concrete system structures and components. In the PDD approach, AI is used to efficiently perform architecture design, data modeling, and interface design. This phase creates the blueprint for the system based on the requirements gathered in the requirements definition phase.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Design a system architecture that satisfies requirements
- Define efficient and scalable data models
- Design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces
- Define integration and communication between modules
- Ensure design meets non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.)

### 1.3 Scope

- System architecture design (layers, components, module structure)
- Database design and data modeling
- User interface and experience (UI/UX) design
- API and interface design
- Security architecture and authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Optimization of architecture for performance and scalability
