## Overview

The testing phase is a critical part of the Prompt-driven Development (PDD) methodology. Unlike traditional software testing, PDD testing verifies the quality, consistency, and security of both prompts and AI-generated outputs. This document presents effective prompt-based testing approaches for the PDD environment.

## Types of Prompt-based Tests & Approaches

### 1. Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies that prompts and generated code meet the intended functional requirements.

#### Testing Approaches:
- **Input-Output Testing**: Validate the accuracy of prompt responses to various inputs
- **Scenario-based Testing**: End-to-end testing based on real-world usage scenarios
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality is maintained after prompt optimization

#### Best Practices:
- Design parameterized test cases including prompt variations
- Automate compilation and functionality verification of code generation results
- Systematically test boundary conditions and edge cases

### 2. Consistency & Stability Testing

Consistency testing verifies that the same prompt produces consistently high-quality results under various conditions.

#### Testing Approaches:
- **Repetition Testing**: Execute the same prompt multiple times to verify consistency
- **Temperature Variation Testing**: Evaluate response stability across different temperature (randomness) settings
- **Model Version Compatibility**: Verify response consistency across model updates

#### Best Practices:
- Collect a large sample size for statistical analysis of results
- Define standardized metrics for measuring response variability
- Implement continuous monitoring for early detection of performance degradation

### 3. Security & Red Team Testing

Security testing focuses on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in prompt-based systems.

#### Testing Approaches:
- **Prompt Injection Testing**: Attempt to bypass system controls using malicious instructions
- **Boundary Bypass Testing**: Test techniques for circumventing security restrictions
- **Data Leakage Testing**: Assess the potential for sensitive information extraction

#### Best Practices:
- Explore vulnerabilities using a systematic red team approach
- Establish immediate mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities
- Automate security testing and implement continuous security monitoring

### 4. Usability & Heuristic Testing

Usability testing evaluates the ease of use, user experience, and adherence to heuristic principles in the generated outputs.

#### Testing Approaches:
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Review outputs against established usability heuristics
- **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Simulate user tasks to identify usability issues
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt designs or output formats

#### Best Practices:
- Involve actual users in the testing process for authentic feedback
- Prioritize issues based on their impact on user experience
- Iterate on prompt designs based on usability test findings

## Test Metrics & Evaluation Criteria

| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Number and severity of identified security vulnerabilities | Security scans and red team tests |
| **Bias Score** | Degree of bias in generated outputs | Standardized bias evaluation tools |

### Test Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria for prompt-based systems should consider the following elements:

1. **Functional Requirements Fulfillment**: All critical functional requirements must be met
