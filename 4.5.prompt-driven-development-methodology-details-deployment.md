## Deployment & Maintenance Strategies

### Deployment Strategies

The optimal deployment strategy for prompt-based systems depends on system scale, criticality, and user base. Key strategies include:

#### 1. Blue/Green Deployment
- **Description:** Prepare two identical environments (blue and green), one hosting the current version and the other the new version, enabling rapid traffic switching
- **When to Use:** Zero-downtime updates for critical systems, fast rollback required
- **Advantages:** No downtime, fast rollback, full testing possible
- **Considerations:** Extra infrastructure cost, data sync complexity

#### 2. Canary Deployment
- **Description:** Gradually expose the new version to a small subset of users or traffic while monitoring
- **When to Use:** Safely deploy to large user bases, measure real user response
- **Advantages:** Minimized risk, real-world validation, incremental issue detection
- **Considerations:** Longer deployment period, multiple versions in operation

#### 3. Phased Rollout
- **Description:** Deploy new version by region, user group, or feature in stages
- **When to Use:** Global services, diverse user groups
- **Advantages:** Risk management, regional optimization, efficient resource use
- **Considerations:** Complex coordination, multiple versions over time

#### 4. Shadow Deployment
- **Description:** Send real traffic to both current and new systems, but only the current system responds; new system's responses are logged
- **When to Use:** High-risk changes, uncertain performance impact
- **Advantages:** Zero-risk real-world testing, accurate performance comparison
- **Considerations:** Extra infrastructure cost, complex setup, data processing load

### Maintenance Models

Prompt-based system maintenance combines traditional software maintenance models with prompt-specific elements:

#### 1. Planned Maintenance
- **Periodic Prompt Review:** Regularly review prompt performance and relevance
- **Model Version Upgrades:** Planned upgrades of underlying AI models and compatibility assurance
- **Prompt Library Cleanup:** Remove duplicates and deprecated prompts, optimize library

#### 2. Adaptive Maintenance
- **Model Drift Response:** Monitor and adjust for changes in model behavior over time
- **Usage Pattern Adaptation:** Optimize prompts for changing user behavior
- **Context Update:** Update prompt context for evolving business environment

#### 3. Preventive Maintenance
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly check for security vulnerabilities and prompt injection risks
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Periodic benchmarking to detect performance degradation early
- **Capacity Planning:** Plan infrastructure expansion for increasing usage

#### 4. Corrective Maintenance
- **Prompt Error Fixes:** Immediately resolve identified prompt issues
- **Exception Handling Improvement:** Strengthen handling of unexpected inputs
- **Urgent Security Patches:** Address prompt security vulnerabilities promptly

## Prompt Version Management Best Practices

Prompt version management is a core element of the deployment & maintenance phase in PDD. Best practices include:

### Version Control System
