To successfully implement Prompt-driven Development Methodology (PDD), it is necessary to consider various factors beyond the basic steps and processes. This document covers how to integrate PDD with existing development environments, build the required infrastructure, manage quality, and address ethical aspects.

## Integration Framework

PDD delivers the most value when integrated with existing development methodologies and organizational cultures, rather than being used in isolation. This section discusses how to integrate PDD with various development methodologies and organizational cultures.

### 1. Integration with Existing Development Methodologies
