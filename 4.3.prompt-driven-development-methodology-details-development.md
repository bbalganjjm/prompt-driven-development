   The redesigned architecture and code should provide:
   - Scalable architecture diagram
   - Implementation code for key components
   - Scalability testing and validation methods
   - Operational considerations and monitoring strategies

   Also, include implementation guidance for a Kubernetes environment and application of cloud-native patterns.
   ```

3. **Performance Testing and Profiling Prompt**
   ```
   Please develop a plan to test and profile the performance of the following service:

   Target Service:
   [Service Description]

   Performance Goals:
   [Performance Goals and KPIs]

   Your performance testing plan should include:
   1. Test scenarios and user patterns
      - Normal load scenario
      - Peak load scenario
      - Spike load scenario
   2. Test environment and tool setup
      - JMeter/Gatling test scripts
      - Monitoring tool setup (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
      - Profiling tool setup (YourKit, JProfiler, etc.)
   3. Measurement metrics and data collection methods
      - Response time
      - Throughput
      - Error rate
      - Resource usage
   4. Result analysis and bottleneck identification methods

   Also, include specific test scripts for each scenario and profiling strategies to identify performance bottlenecks.
   ```
